Take-home challenge Repo

## Problem statement
This project has a dataset of offers and some associated metadata around the retailers and brands that are sponsoring the offer. This project also comes with a dataset of some brands that we support on our platform, and the categories that those products belong to.

### Acceptance Criteria
- If a user searches for a category (ex. diapers) the tool should return a list of offers that are relevant to that category
- If a user searches for a brand (ex. Huggies) the tool should return a list of offers that are relevant to that brand
- If a user searches for a retailer (ex. Target) the tool should return a list of offers that are relevant to that retailer
- The tool should also return the score that was used to measure the similarity of the text input with each offer

### What we seek below:
- Detailed responses to each problem, with a focus on the production pipeline surrounding the model.
- Identifies several useful techniques to approach eReceipt classification and entity extraction.
- Demonstrate a knowledge of recent innovations in NLP and a willingness to think about the problem in terms of software engineering rather than an academic exercise
